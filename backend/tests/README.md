# Order Management System Backend Tests

This directory contains tests for the Order Management System backend application.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are written using Jest. These tests verify the functionality of individual components in isolation, such as models, controllers, and middleware.

### Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

To run tests in watch mode (useful during development):

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Test Structure

The tests are organized by component type:

- `models/`: Tests for database models
- `controllers/`: Tests for API controllers
- `middleware/`: Tests for middleware functions
- `routes/`: Tests for API routes
- `utils/`: Tests for utility functions

### Mocking

The tests use Jest's mocking capabilities to isolate the component being tested:

- Database connections are mocked to avoid actual database operations
- External services are mocked to avoid external dependencies
- Authentication is mocked to simulate different user roles

## Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly. These tests focus on the interaction between controllers, models, and the database.

## API Tests

API tests verify the behavior of the API endpoints. These tests make HTTP requests to the API and verify the responses.

## Test Coverage

The test coverage report shows which parts of the code are covered by tests. Aim for high coverage, especially for critical components.

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent of others
2. **Mocking**: Use mocks to isolate the component being tested
3. **Assertions**: Make specific assertions about the expected behavior
4. **Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical components
5. **Maintenance**: Keep tests up to date as the code changes

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to be run in a CI/CD pipeline. The tests should pass before code is deployed to production.

## Troubleshooting

If tests are failing:

1. Check that the test environment is set up correctly
2. Verify that mocks are configured properly
3. Check for changes in the code that might affect the tests
4. Look for timing issues in asynchronous tests
